# Random Joke Generator

## Motivation
This is the first project I have created as part of my coding portfolio.  This is an opportunity to apply my knowledge of the foundational coding concepts I have learned.

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a random message generator.  Each time the user runs the program, it will output a different one-line joke.  Each joke will be automatically generated mad-lib style from three components.  The format will be:
>Why did the
>NOUN
>VERB?
>To get to the
>NOUN.

For example, the output may read:
>Why did the horse cross the road? To get to the other side.

Or:
>Why did the Christmas tree dance a jig? To get to the final countdown.

## Tech Used
This project uses JavaScript running locally via Node.  The script.js file should be executed in a terminal with Node installed.
